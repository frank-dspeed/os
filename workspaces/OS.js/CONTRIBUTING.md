# Contributing

If you want to contribute, but not sure what to do, here's a list of things that I always need help with:

* Translations
* Bug-hunting
* Finding security problems
* Themes and general graphics
* Website design (like the homepage and manuals)
* Documentation

If you need help, or just up for some general discussion, head into the [community forums](https://community.os-js.org/) or [community chat](https://gitter.im/os-js/OS.js).

See [manual](https://manual.os-js.org/v3/development/) for more information.

You can view all open issues on github, which is usually a good starting point if you want to start contributing:
